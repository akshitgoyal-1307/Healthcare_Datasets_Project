Healthcare Datasets Project
Overview
This project analyzes healthcare data to gain insights into various aspects such as billing amounts, medication costs, treatment costs, insurance coverage, and patient satisfaction. The analysis was conducted using Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights.
Objectives
•	To analyze billing amounts by state, city, diagnosis, procedure, and department.
•	To calculate key metrics like total and average medication costs, treatment costs, and out-of-pocket expenses.
•	To understand patient satisfaction trends and their relation to healthcare services.

Key Findings
•	Significant variations in billing amounts were found across different states and cities.
•	Certain procedures and departments were identified as primary cost drivers.
•	Patient satisfaction was correlated with certain healthcare services and treatment outcomes.
Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations:
•	Column Charts: For billing amounts by state and city.
•	Donut Charts: For displaying the share of total billing by procedure.
•	Stacked Bar Charts: For analyzing billing by diagnosis and service type.
Conclusion
